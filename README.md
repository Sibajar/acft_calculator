# ACFT Calculator
As of April 1, 2022, the Army implemented changes to the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) scoring scales to account for both gender and age for the scoring of events. This repo is an RShiny app that references a CSV file with the newest scoring scales that reflect this to calculate ACFT scores using the user provided data. Users will also be notified whether the score is a pass or fail and can see their scores for each event plotted on a bar chart below their total score.

Passing the ACFT requires a *minimum* score of 60 in each event, if a user fails an event they will see that they have failed the test directly under their score. Otherwise, they will see that they have passed.
